                        Overall this assignment went pretty smoothly for me. I've had expereience with html and css in the past
                        so this wasn't too much of a struggle. Somethings that I did learn though were some more basic html tags
                        that I had never used before, like the list tags, as well as tags use to emphasis text, <em>like this.</em>
                        Let me break it down into more individual components.

                        <b>Index.html: </b>
                        <br>
                        I had a lot of fun with this part of the assignment! I wanted to style everything without a secondary file, which
                        definitly my it harder to look nice, but overall it ended up good. It was a fun assignment that allowed me to 
                        get back into html.

                        <br>
                        I like this assignment, within a week or two I'm going to make it so I can just post on the website of this assignment,
                        that way I don't have to edit the html each time I want to make a new post.
