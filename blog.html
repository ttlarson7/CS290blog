                        Overall this assignment went pretty smoothly for me. I've had expereience with html and css in the past
                        so this wasn't too much of a struggle. Somethings that I did learn though were some more basic html tags
                        that I had never used before, like the list tags, as well as tags use to emphasis text, <em>like this.</em>
                        Let me break it down into more individual components. 
                    </p>

                        <b>Index.html: </b>
                        <br>
                        I had a lot of fun with this part of the assignment! I wanted to style everything without a secondary file, which
                        definitly my it harder to look nice, but overall it ended up good. It was a fun assignment that allowed me to 
                        get back into html.

                        <b>Blog.html: </b>
                        <br>
                        I like this assignment, within a week or two I'm going to make it so I can just post on the website of this assignment,
                        that way I don't have to edit the html each time I want to make a new post.

                <h2>Star Wars</h2>
                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>hello there</p>

                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>This assignment was more difficult than I expected. In all honesty I didn't think that html was going to be that hard.
                        I'm going to break down what I struggled with and what I really enjoyed:
                        
                    </p>
                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    The thing I struggled with the most was actually the positioning of the divs. I used dispay: flex, mostly but 
                    it seemed to me that it didn't work, then I retried the exact same thing and it did. Maybe I was making small changes 
                    or did something that wasn't quite right, but anyway it was still challenging. I learned a lot though and ended up enjoying it 
                    in the end.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        The thing I enjoyed most was the general styling of the project. I love making buttons and different cool smooth animations to 
                        make the User Experience better. It's what I really enjoy about web development. I'm excited for future projects where
                        we get to use JS to make it even better.
                        </p>

                <h2>Assignment 3 Blog 3, 11/12/2023</h2>
                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>Assignment Breakdown: This has been my favorite assignment so far, I love working with Javascript and all the unique capabilites
                        that it has. I had to look up how to check if something is in and array in js and also how to insert something into an array in js.
                        Once again GeeksforGeeks was a great source and was unbelivably helpful. I'm going to break down what I struggled with and what I reallyed enjoyed with the assignement.
                        
                    </p>
                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    There was not a ton that I struggled with in this assignment, I think that the biggest thing was the filtering algorithm that
                    I had to implement in order to get the filtering to work. I don't think that I did it the most efficient way possible, but it
                    still works and correclty displays the information based off the filtered results. it was a fun challenge and I really enjoyed trying
                    to figure out what to do with it.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        I meantioned above that I really enjoyed getting the filtering algorithm to work. I also really enjoyed adding the functionality to
                        the buttons. It really made this webstie feel like a website and made it so the whole page started to come together. I'm very excited to start
                        working with node in the next assignment.
                        </p>

                <h2>Assignment 4 Blog 4, 11/20/2023</h2>
                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>Assignment Breakdown: This has been a really interesting assignment. I'm so far a big fan of backend programming and 
                        am very excited to lear more about it. Figuring out how to work with the URLs was definitely the hardest part of the assignment. 
                        As well as the dynamic rendering, I used the documentation for the http protocol a lot to figure out what I was doing. Once again I am 
                        going to break down what I struggled with and what I reallyed enjoyed with the assignement.
                        
                    </p>
                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    The biggest thing I struggled with in this assignment was the dynamic rendering. I had to look up how to do it and then had to implement it,
                    which turned out to be not as bad. Just the initial set up was hard. The second biggest thing I struggled with was getting the page to
                    load index.html initially. It wasn't loading anything at first and it took me awhile to figure out what I had to do.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        I enjoyed actually being able to render content dynamically. Static websties are kinda boring and dynamic ones are much more fun. 
                        For the next assignment I'm hoping we get to data storage and can start to implement a real website!
                        </p>

                <h2>Assignment 5 Blog 5, 12/03/2023</h2>
                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>Assignment Breakdown: This assignment was not as bad as I orginally thought it was going to be. This project really made me grasp how we 
                        can simplify our code by using third party libraries like express and handle-bars. This makes it so much easier to read out code and 
                        makes it a lot simpler to implement. I'm going to break down what I struggled with and what I reallyed enjoyed with the assignement.
                        
                    </p>
                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    The biggest thing I struggled with in this assignment was rendering the body template inside the main template. I didn't realize quite what 
                    I had to do and it took me awhile to figure it out. I didn't realize what making the main template the default, and how that made it so I didn't 
                    have to rerender in every app.get function. I used the handlebar documentation and the code provided in class to help me figure out what
                    I was doing wrong.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        Once I got the the rendering the templates down. From there I really enjoyed the process. Handlebars are super cool and easy to work with. They
                        make the code simple and easy to read. As well as making ti easy to add new elements to the page. I'm excited to keep working with them in the future!
