                        Overall this assignment went pretty smoothly for me. I've had expereience with html and css in the past
                        so this wasn't too much of a struggle. Somethings that I did learn though were some more basic html tags
                        that I had never used before, like the list tags, as well as tags use to emphasis text, <em>like this.</em>
                        Let me break it down into more individual components. 
                    </p>

                        <b>Index.html: </b>
                        <br>
                        I had a lot of fun with this part of the assignment! I wanted to style everything without a secondary file, which
                        definitly my it harder to look nice, but overall it ended up good. It was a fun assignment that allowed me to 
                        get back into html.

                        I like this assignment, within a week or two I'm going to make it so I can just post on the website of this assignment,
                        that way I don't have to edit the html each time I want to make a new post.

                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>hello there</p>

                <div id = "hidden2">
                    <p>This assignment was more difficult than I expected. In all honesty I didn't think that html was going to be that hard.
                        I'm going to break down what I struggled with and what I really enjoyed:
                        
                    </p>
                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    The thing I struggled with the most was actually the positioning of the divs. I used dispay: flex, mostly but 
                    it seemed to me that it didn't work, then I retried the exact same thing and it did. Maybe I was making small changes 
                    or did something that wasn't quite right, but anyway it was still challenging. I learned a lot though and ended up enjoying it 
                    in the end.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        The thing I enjoyed most was the general styling of the project. I love making buttons and different cool smooth animations to 
                        make the User Experience better. It's what I really enjoy about web development. I'm excited for future projects where
                        we get to use JS to make it even better.

                    <p>Assignment Breakdown: This has been my favorite assignment so far, I love working with Javascript and all the unique capabilites
                        that it has. I had to look up how to check if something is in and array in js and also how to insert something into an array in js.
                        Once again GeeksforGeeks was a great source and was unbelivably helpful. I'm going to break down what I struggled with and what I reallyed enjoyed with the assignement.

                    <b><em>Struggled with:</em></b>
                    <p>
                    There was not a ton that I struggled with in this assignment, I think that the biggest thing was the filtering algorithm that
                    I had to implement in order to get the filtering to work. I don't think that I did it the most efficient way possible, but it
                    still works and correclty displays the information based off the filtered results. it was a fun challenge and I really enjoyed trying
                    to figure out what to do with it.
                    </p>
                    <b> <em>Enjoyed:</em></b>
                       <p>
                        I meantioned above that I really enjoyed getting the filtering algorithm to work. I also really enjoyed adding the functionality to
                        the buttons. It really made this webstie feel like a website and made it so the whole page started to come together. I'm very excited to start
                        working with node in the next assignment.
